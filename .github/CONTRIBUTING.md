# Contributing to Terraform - Salesforce Provider

For a set of general guidelines, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) page in the main Terraform repository.

The following are certain Google Workspace Provider-specific things to be aware of when contributing.

## Go

See the [test.yml](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-salesforce/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml#L31) file for which version of Go to use while developing the provider. You can manage it automatically using [`goenv`](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv).

We aim to make the Salesforce Provider a good steward of Go practices. See https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments for common Go mistakes that you should attempt to avoid.

## Tests

### Running Tests

Configuring tests is similar to configuring the provider; see the [Provider Configuration Reference](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/salesforce/latest/docs) for more details. The following environment variables must be set in order to run tests:

```
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID
SALESFORCE_PRIVATE_KEY
SALESFORCE_API_VERSION
SALESFORCE_USERNAME
```

If running tests or the provider against a "Sandbox Org" please be sure to set

```
SALESFORCE_IS_SANDBOX_ORG
```

To a [Golang truthy value](https://pkg.go.dev/strconv#ParseBool)

The tests and provider assume the profile of the specified `SALESFORCE_USERNAME` has "System Administrator" permissions.

When running tests, specify which to run using `TESTARGS`, such as:

```
make testacc TESTARGS='-run=TestAccResourceUser_customSchemas'
```

The `TESTARGS` variable is regexp-like, so multiple tests can be run in parallel by specifying a common substring of those tests (for example, `TestAccResourceUser` to run all user tests).

### Writing Tests

Tests should confirm that a resource can be created, and that the resulting Terraform state has the correct values, as well as the created Salesforce resource.

Tests should confirm that the resource works in a variety of scenarios, and not just that it can be created in a basic fashion.

Resources that support update should have tests for update.

Resources that are importable should have a test that confirms that every field is importable. This should be part of an existing test (in the regular resource_test.go file) as an extra TestStep with the following format:
```
resource.TestStep{
	ResourceName:      "salesforce_user.my-new-user",
	ImportState:       true,
	ImportStateVerify: true,
},
```

## Instructing Terraform to use a local copy of the provider

Note that these instructions apply to `0.15+` however the provider was built using a new [Terraform Framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework) that requires `1.0.3+`.

### Using released terraform binary with local provider binary

Setup:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/salesforce/5.0.0/darwin_amd64
ln -s $GOBIN/terraform-provider-salesforce ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/salesforce/5.0.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-salesforce_v5.0.0
```

Edit the `provider_installation` block in your `~/.terraformrc` file to:
```
plugin_cache_dir   = "~/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"

provider_installation {
	filesystem_mirror {
		path = "~/.terraform.d/plugin-cache"
		include = ["registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/salesforce"]
	}
}
```

Once this setup is complete, terraform will automatically use the binaries generated by the `make build` commands in the `terraform-provider-salesforce` repository instead of downloading the latest versions. To undo this, you can run:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/
```

For more information, check out Hashicorp's documentation on the [provider installation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/providers/requirements.html#in-house-providers) and using [in-house providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/providers/requirements.html#in-house-providers).

If multiple versions are available in a plugin directory (for example after `terraform providers mirror` is used), Terraform will pick the most up-to-date provider version within version constraints. As such, we recommend using a version that is several major versions ahead for your local copy of the provider, such as `5.0.0`.
