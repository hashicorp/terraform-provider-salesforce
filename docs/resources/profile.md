  Profile Resource for the Salesforce Provider. Please note that Users must have a Profile assigned to them, Profiles cannot be deleted if a User is assigned to it, and Salesforce does not allow the deletion of Users, only deactivation. Terraform will warn after destroy of a User that it has only been deactivated and now removed from state. A common issue with this pattern is a Profile and User created in tandem will fail to delete the Profile on destroy due to the lingering assignment. Should you wish to destroy a created Profile, it's advised that an apply that moves all affected Users to a static Profile be run first, after which the Profile can be safely destroyed.

# salesforce_profile (Resource)

Profile Resource for the Salesforce Provider. Please note that Users must have a Profile assigned to them, Profiles cannot be deleted if a User is assigned to it, and Salesforce does not allow the deletion of Users, only deactivation. Terraform will warn after destroy of a User that it has only been deactivated and now removed from state. A common issue with this pattern is a Profile and User created in tandem will fail to delete the Profile on destroy due to the lingering assignment. Should you wish to destroy a created Profile, it's advised that an apply that moves all affected Users to a static Profile be run first, after which the Profile can be safely destroyed.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "salesforce_user_license" "fdc" {
  license_definition_key = "PID_FDC_FREE"
}

resource "salesforce_profile" "example" {
  name            = "example"
  user_license_id = data.salesforce_user_license.fdc.id

## Schema

### Required

- **name** (String) The name of the profile.
- **user_license_id** (String) ID of the UserLicense associated with this profile. Forces replacement if updated.

### Optional

- **description** (String) Description of the profile.
- **permissions** (Map of Boolean) Map of permissions for the profile. At this time specific permissions can only be set, the comprehensive list will not be read from Salesforce. The keys should follow Salesforce 'SnakeCase' format however the 'Permissions' prefix should be omitted. Permissions will not import to state due to a technical limitation, you will need to run a subsequent apply if you have permissions set in config during import.

### Read-Only

- **id** (String) ID of the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Please note, profiles will import without permissions into set, even if
# the config contains permissions. Please run a subsequent apply to sync.
terraform import salesforce_profile.example 00AB0000000abc1AAA
```
